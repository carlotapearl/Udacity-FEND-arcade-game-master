# Udacity Front End Nano Degree Arcade Game

This game was built as a [Udacity](www.udacity.com) Front End Nano Degree project. The purpose is to demostrate mastery of JavaScript Object Oriented Programming.

This game is a pseudo-clone of the classic "frogger" game.  Like Frogger, you move your character across the bug "traffic". You must avoid the bugs to get to the water at the top of the page.

This game was built as part of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

4. Every time you reach the water you collect 100 points. Every time you collect a gem you win 20 points!
