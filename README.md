# Udacity Front End Nano Degree Arcade Game

This game was built as a [Udacity](www.udacity.com) Front End Nano Degree project. The purpose is to demostrate mastery of JavaScript Object Oriented Programming.

This game is a pseudo-clone of the classic "frogger" game.  Like Frogger, you move your character across the bug "traffic". You must avoid the bugs to get to the water at the top of the page.

This game was built as part of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

Move into empty spaces, avoiding the bugs.  If your player collides into a bug or a bug gets your player, the game is over.

4. Collect the gems to win more points.

### How Do You Win?

Winning is simple! If your player makes it to the water, you win. Try and see how many points you rack up with the 3 lives provided.
